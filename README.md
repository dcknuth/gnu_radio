# Experimenting with SDR and GnuRadio
I wanted to explore SDR (Software Defined Radio) and the GnuRadio tool a bit. Here are some notes so I can remember and maybe help others.

* [Setup a VM](vm_setup.md) GnuRadio runs best from Linux. Since I use Windows as my main OS, I wanted a VM to work on. I use Virtual Box currently as my VM tool
* [Install GnuRadio](gnu_radio1.md) Installing GnuRadio and basic testing
* [HackRF One Tutorials](gnu_radio2.md) Most of the notes from the Great Scott series of tutorials with the HackRF One
* [Sample Rate](gnu_radio3.md) A look at the effects of sample rate after working the Gnu Radio Tutorial
* [Generate FSK](gnu_radio4.md) Learning about frequency shift keying by trying to build the same signal as the remote from a fog machine
* [Installing HackRF One](gnu_radio5.md) Moving from an RTL-SDR to a HackRF One with Gnu Radio
